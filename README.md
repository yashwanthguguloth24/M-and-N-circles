# M and N circles

This a repo of M and N circles implementation in python from control systems


M circles are called constant magnitude Loci and N circles are called as constant phase angle Loci.
These are helpful in determining the closed-loop frequency response of unity negative feedback systems.

To start with we need to 

       -First draw circles of different values of M and N respectively.
       -Then draw nyquist plot of given open loop transfer funcrtion over constant M circles and N circles.
       -Then find the intersection points of M circles and nyquist plot and similarly with N circles.
       -Plot (omega,20log(M)) to give magnitude plot of closed loop transfer function.
       -Plot (omega,tan^-1(N)) to give phase plot of closed loop transfer function.
       -Verify it with original bode plot of CLTF.
